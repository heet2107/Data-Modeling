Relationships-


Users to recipes = one to many. One user can create many recipes but each recipe can have only one creator.


Recipes to ingredients = many to many. An ingredient can be included in any number of recipes and a recipe can include many ingredients.


Recipe to shopping list = one to one. Each recipe has a unique shopping list and each shopping list can create just one recipe.


Recipes to public and private = one to many. One recipe can be only either public or private not both. But public and private can contain many recipes each.
